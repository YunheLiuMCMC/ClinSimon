Description: Implements methods for managing enrollment challenges in Simon's 
    Two-Stage Design for phase II clinical trials. Provides functions for:
    (1) adaptive threshold adjustment to handle under-enrollment,
    (2) sample size recalibration for over-enrollment scenarios, and
    (3) comprehensive post-inference analysis tools including power calculation,
    confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. These methods help maintain 
    statistical rigor while adapting to real-world enrollment variations in
    clinical trials.
